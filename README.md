Project Name: Vrinda Store Visualization/Dashboard  
Objective: To create an annual sales report for 2022 for the Vrinda Store to understand its customers and project sales for the year 2023.

### Report Preparation Steps
1. Compare sales and orders using a single chart.
2. Identify the month with the highest orders and sales.
3. Determine which gender purchased more items during 2022.
4. Analyze different order statuses (returned/not returned) in 2022.
5. List the top 10 Indian provinces/states contributing most to sales during 2022.
6. Explore the relationship between "Age" and "Gender" based on the number of orders.
7. Find which channel (online platform or offline) contributes the most to increasing sales.
8. Identify the highest selling category.

### Key Insights
1. Female customers are likely to purchase more (65%) than male customers (35%).
2. The top three contributing Indian provinces are Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Uttar Pradesh (35%).
3. The adult age group (30-49 years old) contributes the most (50%).
4. Channels like "Amazon," "Flipkart," and "Myntra" contribute the most (80%).

### Final Recommendations to Improve Vrinda Store Sales
- Target female customers aged 30-49 years living in "Maharashtra," "Karnataka," and "Uttar Pradesh" by offering ads, discounts, and coupons available on "Amazon," "Flipkart," and "Myntra."
